## Major: Information Systems

This project relates to my major because it was a lot of work in web design. This is something that I have not been good at in the past so it took me a while to make it visually pleasing, but that was the point of this for me. I wanted to make it look good and not just thrown together.

## Purpose

This website is used for students at Coastal to fill out surveys about the campus, the school sports, and their classes. It is a simple way to get information from students about things they like and dislike about coastal.

## Usage

- Open your browser
- Go to the website
- Choose a survey to complete
- Complete the survey
- Choose to do another survey or just close the browser

## Future Development

- I would have liked to be able to send an email thanking the user for filling out the survey, but I could not figure out how to make it work.

## Dependencies

None. This was pretty simple, just wanted to improve my CSS skills.
